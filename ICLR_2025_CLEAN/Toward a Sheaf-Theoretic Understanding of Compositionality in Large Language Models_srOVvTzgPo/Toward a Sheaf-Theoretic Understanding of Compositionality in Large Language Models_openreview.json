    "abstract": "Compositionality has long been considered a fundamental aspect of human cognition -  enabling the learning, manipulation, and generation of natural language. Understanding how this concept applies to Large Language Models (LLMs) and how it can be effectively evaluated remains a key challenge. In this work, we explore the potential of formalizing cognitive notions from theory, such as compositionality, to develop more nuanced evaluation frameworks for LLMs. Using a sheaf-theoretic approach, we define compositionality through four distinct conditions that capture its multifaceted nature. This formalization offers a structured perspective on evaluating LLMs, moving beyond surface-level assessments to uncover deeper insights into their behavior. Our findings suggest that theoretical frameworks like this one can play a crucial role in advancing the understanding and evaluation of LLMs, providing a foundation for more comprehensive and precise performance analyses.",

      "strengths": "- The paper presents a nice initial effort in defining compositionality with a mathematical framework rigorously\n- The paper is well-structured and well-written",
      "weaknesses": "- (Major) Limited novelty and applicability of the findings:\n\t- The formalization of compositionality via the sheaf-theoric framework is novel, but it is not clear its purpose, how it can be used in practice in the real world and whether it's correct or not (due to a weak experimental part).\n\t- There is no novelty in the evaluation part since it uses known datasets and results for the literature, except for the introduction of the COMPCOMB dataset.\n\t- In general, there are very few contributions that justify this paper.\n- (Critical) The experimental part is extremely weak and not convincing:\n\t- In Table 1 there is a significant drop between base models and instruction-tuned models like a huge ~40% (0.82 vs 0.42) on SCAN. The authors provide an explanation that  L402 \"instruction tuning likely leads to a loss in the development of restriction maps, which could be explained by the fact that while the model retains its most important generalizations, it loses some local information to accommodate instruction tuning, leading to loss of restriction mapping\". This is in contrast with results in the literature where instruction-tuned models perform generally better. I believe there is not enough empirical evidence to sustain this statement and the huge performance drop might be due to issues in the evaluation setup. The authors mention the use of \"computing the model’s log probabilities for two possible completions\" but this has been shown to be problematic, especially in instruction-tuned models that might lose the calibration in their logits after RLHF (https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14499 , https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08774). I suggest using a different eval strategy (e.g., comparison with the ground truth and exact match metric) and distinguishing results between instruction-tuning and models tuned via RLHF.\n\t- In general, I don't think the experiments are thorough enough to convince me without any doubt that an increase/decrease of the score on a specific dataset (e.g., SCAN) means an increase/decrease of a compositional condition defined in the framework (e.g., Restriction Condition). There are several other factors involved in the evaluation that might lead to spurious correlations and an increase/decrease in the score. I think the author should definitively pay more attention to the evaluation of the components defined in the framework.\n- (Minor) The presentation of the results is not optimal:\n\t- The results proposed (Figures and Tables) are never referenced from the text. This creates ambiguity in the text because it's not clear what results you are commenting on. \n\t- The proposed plots lack clarity. The rationale for using a radar plot to compare accuracies in Figure 1 is unclear, and both the scale and raw values in the plot are difficult to interpret.\n- (Minor) There is a minimal discussion of related works.

The paper would be more complete if authors include the importance of LLMs compositionality in applications. What are the aspects or benefits if LLMs gains better compositionality performance.\n- There is limited description of the experiment setup. It would be preferable if there are more justifications for the methodology and choice of prompting.\n- (line 908) There is a table or figure missing about the SCAN setup, showing **??**\n- Appendix also shows the template used but it would be better to include additional examples in each dataset to help readers gain insights.\n- There are many extremely long sentences, which requires a second pass and thus affect the readability of the paper.",

While the proposed sheaf-theoretic framework is innovative and offers a high-level definition of compositionality, its real-world applicability remains uncertain.

Compositionality is a central concept of human cognition that understands complex things through simpler components. This new definition of compositionally contains four distinct conditions: restriction maps, gluing conditions, locality conditions, and natural transformations.\n\n2. The experiments conducted across multiple LLMs (such as Llama2, CodeLlama, and Mistral) show that larger models tend to exhibit better compositional abilities overall. However, instruction-tuned models experience a significant decline in performance, particularly in tasks related to the restriction condition and natural transformations. This suggests that while instruction tuning may enhance generalization, it can degrade the model's ability to handle compositional information."
