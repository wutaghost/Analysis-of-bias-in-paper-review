    "abstract": "Mainstream test-time adaptation (TTA) techniques endeavor to mitigate distribution shifts via entropy minimization for multi-class classification, inherently increasing the probability of the most confident class. However, when encountering multi-label instances, the primary challenge stems from the varying number of labels per image, and prioritizing only the highest probability class inevitably undermines the adaptation of other positive labels. To address this issue, we investigate TTA within multi-label scenario (ML--TTA), developing Bound Entropy Minimization (BEM) objective to simultaneously increase the confidence of multiple top predicted labels. Specifically, to determine the number of labels for each augmented view, we retrieve a paired caption with yielded textual labels for that view. These labels are allocated to both the view and caption, called weak label set and strong label set with the same size k. Following this, the proposed BEM considers the highest top-k predicted labels from view and caption as a single entity, respectively, learning both view and caption prompts concurrently. By binding top-k predicted labels, BEM overcomes the limitation of vanilla entropy minimization, which exclusively optimizes the most confident class. Across the MSCOCO, VOC, and NUSWIDE multi-label datasets, our ML--TTA framework equipped with BEM exhibits superior performance compared to the latest SOTA methods, across various model architectures, prompt initialization, and varying label scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/Jinx630/ML-TTA.",

      "body": "This paper focuses on test time adaptation under a multi-label setting, this is an early work in this field.  This paper first analyzes why widely used entropy loss is not helpful in multi-label settings, and proposes a new method to adapt with multi-label. Then, the author proposes the view prompt and caption prompt to adapt the model for each instance. The experiments on three datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method."

The paper demonstrates robust experimentation across diverse datasets (MSCOCO, VOC, NUSWIDE) and architectures (e.g., RN50, ViT-B/16), showcasing the generalizability and efficacy of the proposed method.\n2. The introduction of the Bound Entropy Minimization (BEM) for Multi-Label Test-Time Adaptation (ML–TTA) is a significant theoretical and practical advancement. It effectively addresses the challenges inherent in multi-label test-time adaptation, a space where traditional single-label approaches like entropy minimization fall short.",

The explanations surrounding the implementation of label binding and how the paired captions are retrieved need additional clarity for readers less familiar with the intricate mechanisms of vision-language model adaptations.\n2. While the paper effectively shows ML–TTA's superiority over traditional methods, it would benefit from a more detailed discussion about the choice of baseline methods and potential reasons for their relative underperformance.",

Unlike traditional test-time adaptation (TTA) that optimizes for the most confident single-label prediction, BEM increases the confidence of the top-k predicted labels simultaneously. This approach addresses the challenges associated with multi-label data where prioritizing one label can reduce the adaptation effectiveness for others. The framework also incorporates paired captions as pseudo-positive labels to guide adaptation. Experiments conducted on MSCOCO, VOC, and NUSWIDE datasets demonstrate that ML–TTA outperforms existing methods and the original CLIP model, showcasing superior adaptability across diverse architectures and prompt setups."

      "weaknesses": "1) In your paper, the choice of top-k seems to be very important, so how do you determine the setting of k? You said \"we retrieve a paired caption with derived textual labels for each view, which then serves as weak label set of size k for the corresponding view.\" How do you make sure the selected weak label set is reliable?\n2) I can not see any explanation about the \"augmented view\" in this paper, what is the definition of it and what effort does it have in the framework?\n3) The comparison methods you selected in the paper may be not designed for multi-label datasets, so is this comparison fair? Could you add more ML-TTA specific framework to the results?\n4) Some details: Table 1 lacks a description of evaluation metric; Marking the second-best result in the experimental results is more beneficial to the reader.",
