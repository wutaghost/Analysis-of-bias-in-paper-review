    "keywords": "Individual user preferences, On-Device LLM",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized how we interact with technology, but their personalization to individual user preferences remains a significant challenge, particularly in on-device applications. Traditional methods often depend heavily on labeled datasets and can be resource-intensive. To address these issues, we present Adaptive Self-Supervised Learning Strategies (ASLS), which utilizes self-supervised learning techniques to personalize LLMs dynamically. The framework comprises a user profiling layer for collecting interaction data and a neural adaptation layer for real-time model fine-tuning. This innovative approach enables continuous learning from user feedback, allowing the model to generate responses that align closely with user-specific contexts. The adaptive mechanisms of ASLS minimize computational demands and enhance personalization efficiency. Experimental results across various user scenarios illustrate the superior performance of ASLS in boosting user engagement and satisfaction, highlighting its potential to redefine LLMs as highly responsive and context-aware systems on-device.",

In particular, inconsistent use of symbols and lack of explanations make the methodology difficult to understand. It is recommended that the authors revise this section and include an illustrative diagram to improve readability.\n2. Equation (2) indicates that the personalization approach in this paper still relies on label fitting, suggesting it has not eliminated the dependence on extensive labeled data as claimed in the introduction.\n3. This paper's general approach looks like customizing personalized parameters for LLMs based on user interaction data, and this core idea seems quite similar to HYDRA [1]. What are the main innovations presented in this paper, and what are its advantages?\n4. The readability of the experimental results and analysis is poor. The experimental tables are difficult to understand; for example, in Table 1, why do different methods correspond to different datasets? Regarding the analysis of experiments, the statement \"Significant enhancements observed in user engagement metrics\" does not provide a clear definition of what engagement metrics are.\n5. There is a lack of comparison with some baselines in the experiments, such as [1].\n[1] HYDRA: Model Factorization Framework for Black-Box LLM Personalization.",

For example, the fourth paragraph is very confusing, as it includes too many disparate elements—recommendation, multi-modal object recognition, and fairness.\n\n**W2.** The connections between different parts of the method are also unclear, with issues of inconsistent notation. Additionally, there is no clear demonstration of how it better addresses the problem of dynamic updates; it still seems that updates are needed for each proposed module when new data appears.\n\n**W3.** The experiments are also confusing. For example, in Table 1, why do different methods correspond to different datasets? How does this ensure fair comparison?\n\n**W4.** It is not clear how the paper demonstrates self-supervised learning. According to equation (2), it still appears to be supervised learning.\n\n**W5.** The selection of baselines may also need improvement. For instance, the chosen recommendation baseline, PALR, is not the current state-of-the-art LLM-based recommendation method.",
