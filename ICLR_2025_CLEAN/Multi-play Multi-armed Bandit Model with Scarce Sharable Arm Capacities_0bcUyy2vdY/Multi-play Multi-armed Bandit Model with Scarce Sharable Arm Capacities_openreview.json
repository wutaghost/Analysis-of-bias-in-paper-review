    "abstract": "This paper revisits multi-play multi-armed bandit with shareable arm capacities problem (MP-MAB-SAC), for the purpose of \nrevealing fundamental insights on the statistical limits and data efficient learning. The MP-MAB-SAC is tailored for resource allocation problems arising from LLM inference serving, edge intelligence, etc. It consists of $K$ arms and each arm $k$ is associated with an unknown but deterministic capacity $m_k$ and per-unit capacity reward with mean $\\mu_k$ and $\\sigma$ sub-Gaussian noise.  The aggregate reward mean of an arm scales linearly with the number of plays assigned to it until the number of plays hit the capacity limit $m_k$, and then the aggregate reward mean is fixed to $m_k \\mu_k$. At each round only the aggregate reward is revealed to the learner. \nOur contributions are three folds.   1) \\textit{Sample complexity:} we prove a minmax lower bound for the sample complexity of learning the arm capacity  $\\Omega(\\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\mu^2_k} \\log \\delta^{-1})$, and propose an algorithm to exactly match this lower bound. \nThis result closes the sample complexity gap of Wang et al. (2022a), whose lower and upper bounds are $\\Omega(\\log \\delta^{-1})$ and  $O (\\frac{m^2_k \\sigma^2}{\\mu^2_k} \\log \\delta^{-1})$ respectively.  2) \\textit{Regret lower bounds:}  we prove an instance-independent regret lower bound   $\\Omega( \\sigma \\sqrt{TK} )$  and instance-dependent regret lower bound $\\Omega(\\sum_{k=1}^K\\frac{c\\sigma^2}{\\mu_k^2} \\log T)$.  This result provides the first instance-independent regret lower bound and strengths the instance-dependent regret lower bound of Wang et al. (2022a) $\\Omega(\\sum_{k=1}^K \\log T)$.   3) \\textit{Data efficient exploration:}we propose an algorithm named \\texttt{PC-CapUL}, in which we use prioritized coordination of arm capacities upper/lower confidence bound (UCB/LCB) to efficiently balance the exploration vs. exploitation trade-off.  We prove both instance-dependent and instance-independent upper bounds for \\texttt{PC-CapUL}, which match the lower bounds up to some acceptable model-dependent factors. This result provides the first instance-independent upper bound, and has the same dependency on $m_k$ and $\\mu_k$ as Wang et al. (2022a) with respect to instance-dependent upper bound.But there is less information about arm capacity in our aggregate reward setting.  Numerical experiments validate the data efficiency of \\texttt{PC-CapUL}.",

The author states in the introduction that the algorithm has applications to LLM inference serving. I believe it’s necessary to provide some LLM-related experiments to support this statement.",
      "questions": "1. should we assume that $\\mu_k\\ge c$ for all $k$? The authors state that the optimal action is always $(m_1,\\dots, m_K)$ in line 211. It seems that this only holds when $\\mu_k\\ge c$ for all $k$.\n2. what is \\mu in Theorem 1. I did not find the definition.\n3. I am curious about how could the sample complexity in Theorem 2 gets rid of the dependence of N. Intuitively, even there is no noise (sigma = 0), for any algorithm, it still need at least $\\log N$ rounds to find the true $m_k$ by binary search. Is the dependence on $N$ hidden in $\\xi$?\n\n\nTypos:\nline 224: $a_{k,t}$ instead of $a_k$\nline 289: for large probability -> with high probability\nline 383: to played with -> to play with",

      "strengths": "•\tThe problem of Multi play multi-armed bandit problem is an interesting setting to study and improve the foundation of it as it pertains to main real-world settings including LLM inference serving. The work re-establishes that with emphasis on theoretical guarantees.\n\n•\tThe work provides theoretical improvements in sample complexity compared to the existing work on  MP-MAB-SAC. It tends to close the sample complexity gap found in the previous work in Reference A\n\n•\tThe authors also provide a new Improved algorithm, PC-CapUL that performs much better than other existing algorithms and have a solid theoretical backing to it with proved theoretical Regret bound guarantees.\n\n•\tThe experiments cover the regimes where the number of arms is larger which predominantly requires more exploration to take place. The developed algorithm provides much better performance in terms of regret compared to other existing algorithms in this experimental setting.\n\nReference:\n [A] Xuchuang Wang, Hong Xie, and John C.

      "weaknesses": "•\tThe experimentation design could have been done much better with the inclusion of better baseline comparison in addition to the algorithm found in Reference A . Also, utilizing a real-world dataset for evaluation would have further complemented these theoretical results.\n\n•\tThe readability of the paper could be much improved. Also, a brief intuitive explanation like a proof sketch could be added in the main text to help the reader get the intuitive logic and understanding of the proof techniques. \n\n•\tA more detailed theoretical comparative analysis like how regret fares against the regret of other algorithms would make the argument much stronger for the developed PC-CapUL algorithm. Moreover, having such a discussion would also help us uncover insights like how the regret bound behaves in different regimes.\n\nReference:\n [A] Xuchuang Wang, Hong Xie, and John C. S. Lui.

      "questions": "1.\t$m_k$ is deterministic and well known beforehand as to how many pulls can be made in a round. However, there is a constant movement cost $c$ associated to an arm. In case of LLM query, the number of pulls is associated to the amount of query a server instance can handle.\n\nAre $m_k$ and moving cost $c$ dependent in this scenario? If so, how do this implication sit with all the theoretical proof, or do they have to be independent? A clarification on this would help the readers utilize the developed algorithms on many scenarios where the dependencies are crucial. \n\n2.\tWhy is ordering of plays of arm selection important in $a_t$, providing some details on it will avoid ambiguity around its objective of whether to maximize the resource utilization or to maximum capacity of the arm?\n\n3.\tAlso, with respect to movement cost, in the experiment setting, it has been assigned to an arbitrary value of 0.1 .  Is there any fundamental reason for that? Also, how can they be evaluated in a practical scenario when they are also coupled with reward formulation? Adding some details around them can greatly improve the clarity of the work.  \n\n4.\tIt would be nice to see how the experiments scale up with varying parameters like changing the $m_k$ and changing the movement cost etc ? This will help us understand the empirical performance of the algorithm much better.\n\nReference:\n [A] Xuchuang Wang, Hong Xie, and John C. S. Lui.

      "body": "This paper studies the multi play multi-armed bandit problem having shared arm capacity where the in each round, the learner gets to select the arm for a number of pulls capped by the capacity limit with the goal of maximizing the total reward at the end of the play. The authors propose a new reward function and develop a new algorithm PC-CapUL for this problem setting. The developed algorithm provides tighter bounds on sample complexity and regret in comparison to the existing works, efficiently balances exploration and exploitation.

      "weaknesses": "- One main concern is the motivation of this paper to consider the case where $N\\geq \\sum m_k$. In this case, the problem seems to be easier (in the sense of algorithm design) since you will definitely explore each action sufficiently enough to figure out the exact $m_k$ while in the opposite case $N< \\sum m_k$, the problem seems to be harder since you need to decide the exploration amount for the suboptimal $k$. Can the authors explicitly justify the choice of studying the $N\\geq \\sum m_k$ case and why it is challenging compared to the previous case?\n- This also leads to the question about the comparison between the lower/upper bound shown in this paper and [Wang et al., 2022a]. While the authors claim better lower bound, I wonder whether the upper/lower bound are comparable in these two cases? Can the algorithm that is derived in this setting adapted to the other? Moreover, I am not sure why equation (5) is more reasonable since it makes sense to me to have the noise's variance larger when $m_k$ or $a_k$ is large.\n- As for the upper bound, the bounds in Theorem 5 seems to be suboptimal since it seems to be dependent on $\\frac{\\max_i \\mu_i}{\\min_i \\mu_i}$, which can be large.\n- I do not understand the lower bound argument shown in Theorem 4. When the cost $c=0$, then this ratio becomes 0, which is surely not informative. In addition, why is the ratio independent of $m_k$? Can the authors explain more on this?\n- Typos:\n  - Line 223: it -> if\n  - Line 224: a_k -> a_{t,k}?\n  - Line 471: depended -> dependent \n  - Line 751: missing lemma reference.\n  - missing periods at the end of many theorem statements (e.g. Theorem 4,5,6..)",

      "weaknesses": "I have the following concerns: \n\n1. The writing quality of this paper falls below the standards required for publication in ICLR. Issues such as clarity, rigor, and basic grammatical correctness are prevalent. It appears that the authors did not thoroughly review the paper before submission. From a writing perspective, the paper remains in draft form: numerous typos, confusing notations, and grammatical errors hinder readability. For example,  (1) in Lemma 2, $\\epsilon^{uE}$ should be $\\epsilon^{UE}$; (2) in the proof of Lemma 2 “Bourel et al., 2020” is even not cited; (3) in the proof of Theorem 1, which lemma is used here? Besides, this theorem should be proved more formally; (4) What is the first baseline “MP-MAB-SA” in the experiments?\n\n2. The explanations provided in the paper are insufficient. (1) In Section 1, more concrete examples of the model's practical applications are needed. (2) The claim that certain changes in settings make the model more suitable for LLMs requires stronger evidence. For instance, the movement cost $c$ (which is known to the learner) seems irrelevant. (3) The paper should provide a more in-depth analysis of the experimental results, going beyond mere statements of fact.\n\n3. The comparison with the previous work seems not fair. (1) Since $N \\ge M$ makes the learner only need to learn the capacity $m_k$, without needing to learn the rank of the arms, the learning task seems easier. (2) In lines 307~310, is there any evidence to show stability is getting better? Besides, I’m kind of confused about this result because the robustness v.s. regret usually has some trade-off, which means the increasing of stability may (not always) lead to the decreasing of performance.",
