    "abstract": "Recent advances in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) have shown Low- Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to be an effective implicit regularizer for large language models. Building on these findings, we propose UnoLoRA, a novel approach that leverages a single shared LoRA module for efficient multi-task learning. While existing methods typically use separate LoRA adaptations for each task, our approach demonstrates that a single shared adapter can effectively capture both task-specific and task-agnostic knowledge. We further introduce UnoLoRA*, an enhanced variant that employs a shared hypernetwork to generate task-specific embeddings, improving convergence and task adaptation. Our method significantly reduces trainable parameters to just 0.05% per task while maintaining competitive performance on the GLUE benchmark. Our analysis reveals that the A and B matrices in our shared LoRA adapter naturally develop complementary roles: A matrices capture generalizable features across tasks, while B matrices specialize in task-specific representations. Our results show that sharing a single LoRA adapter can achieve efficient multi-task learning while significantly reducing memory requirements, making it particularly valuable for resource-constrained applications.",

      "strengths": "- The paper conducts comprehensive experiments and analysis to verify the proposed method.\n- The paper is well structured, proposing an architecture, UnoLoRA, which integrates a shared hypernetwork that generates task-specific scaling factors.",
      "weaknesses": "- The experiments are conducted on T5-series models, which are from 4 years ago. Using a more recent model doesn't necessarily mean aiming for the current SOTA (state-of-the-art), but rather that the behaviors of stronger models might differ, making experiments on T5 impractical. For instance, current models, after instruction tuning, demonstrate strong zero-shot generalization across tasks, making multi-task learning less important.\n- In the first table, the method proposed in this paper does not outperform HyperFormer++, even though they have different amounts of training parameters, the average effectiveness is also quite lacking. Therefore, the experimental results of this paper are not very convincing.",
      "questions": "- Why not use a self-implemented LoRA in both multi-task and single-task scenarios, since LoRA is relatively simple to implement?\n- Is there a detailed efficiency analysis available?\n-  How to acquire the task embeddings in the paper?",

UnoLoRA leverages LoRA's implicit regularization properties to facilitate multitask learning by using a single adapter shared across all tasks, instead of separate adapters for each task. This approach drastically reduces trainable parameters to 0.05% per task while maintaining competitive performance with existing multitask methods. The model is evaluated on the GLUE benchmark and demonstrates parameter efficiency and improved generalization by capturing both shared and task-specific information.

      "strengths": "- Simple and seemingly effective way of parameterizing low-rank adapters in the multitask setting. The idea is timely---there have been a lot of improvements in LoRA and related schemes in the last couple of years, and revisiting conditional computation + adapter combinations seems like a promising direction.",
      "weaknesses": "- Comparatively minor tweak of an existing idea. This wouldn't be an issue on\n  its own, except for the fact that the various changes are not evaluated in\n  a way that enables direct comparison to HyperFormers, as described below.\n\n- Inconsistencies and missing details in the description of the method. Fig 1\n  makes reference to a \"Task-specific A\" parameter that is not mentioned\n  anywhere in the formal description of the method---is it used, and if so,\n  where? Additionally, the experiments make reference to a method called\n  UnoLoRA$^*$, which achieves slightly better performance than the base method\n  but does not appear to be described anywhere.\n\n- Major issues in evaluation. The paper's main results are summarized in Fig\n  6(a), which show that UnoLoRA and HyperFormers both pareto-dominate training\n  separate adapters for each task---UnoLoRA involves fewer parameters at the\n  same level of performance, while HyperFormers give increased accuracy but are\n  slightly less parameter-efficient than UnoLoRA. I have two concerns here.\n\n    - First, the individual differences between UnoLoRA and HyperFormers are\n      never individually evaluated, making it impossible to figure which (if any)\n      are responsible for the performance differences.\n\n    - Second, and more fundamentally---the whole point of adapter-based methods\n      is that they provide a tunable parameter (the adapter rank) that trades\n      off between accuracy and parameter count. So what we really need to see\n      is the entire accuracy / efficiency curve for both model classes, rather\n      than an arbitrary point on each. In fact, if I understand correctly,\n      even the size of the adapter is totally incomparable between the two\n      models being compared: this paper trains UnoLoRA with a rank of 8, while\n      the results copied from the HyperFormers paper appear to use a rank of 24.\n\n  Without a minimal comparison (or a complete frontier from each model), it is\n  possible that all observed differences between methods result from\n  incomparable hyperparameter choices.\n\n- Major formatting issues: nearly every citation in the paper is incorrectly formatted (using \\citet instead of \\citep). It seems likely that this paper didn't receive even a single round of proofreading, and should not have been submitted to ICLR in its current form.",
      "questions": "- How does performance change as rank is varied?\n- How do individual components of the method affect performance?\n- What is UnoLoRA$^*$?\n- Is there a task-specific $A$ matrix or not?",

      "body": "This paper presents a method called UnoLoRA, a procedure for constructing\nlow-rank Transformer adapters in a multi-task setting by training a network to\napply task-specific transformations to a shared adapter. In particular, while\nstandard LoRA parameterizes weight matrices as $W + AB^\\top$ for low-rank\n$A$ and $B$, UnoLoRA parameterizes them as $W + A ~\\mathrm{diag}(H(t)) ~ B^\\top$,\nwhere $t$ is a task representation that includes both a discrete identifier\nand example data and positional embeddings, and $H$ is a hypernetwork. A similar recipe was previously\nexplored by Karimi Mahabadi et al. (2021) under the name of \"HyperFormers\"; as\nfar as I can tell, the main differences are that:\n\n- HyperFormers condition only on task IDs, while UnoLoRA conditions on example\n  input data\n\n- HyperFormers also modulate LayerNorm parameters, and not just adapters\n\n- HyperFormers use a slightly different adapter parameterization from the modern LoRA recipe, with\n  a nonlinearity in the middle"
