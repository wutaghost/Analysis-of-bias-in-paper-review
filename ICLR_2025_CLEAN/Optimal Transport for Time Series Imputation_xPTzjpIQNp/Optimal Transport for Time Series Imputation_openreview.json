    "abstract": "Missing data imputation through distribution alignment has demonstrated advantages for non-temporal datasets but exhibits suboptimal performance in time-series applications. The primary obstacle is crafting a discrepancy measure that simultaneously (1) captures temporal patterns—accounting for periodicity and temporal dependencies inherent in time-series—and (2) accommodates non-stationarity, ensuring robustness amidst multiple coexisting temporal patterns. In response to these challenges, we introduce the Proximal Spectrum Wasserstein (PSW) discrepancy, a novel discrepancy tailored for comparing two \\textit{sets} of time-series based on optimal transport. It incorporates a pairwise spectral distance to encapsulate temporal patterns, and a selective matching regularization to accommodate non-stationarity. Subsequently, we develop the PSW for Imputation (PSW-I) framework, which iteratively refines imputation results by minimizing the PSW discrepancy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PSW-I effectively accommodates temporal patterns and non-stationarity, outperforming prevailing time-series imputation methods. Code is available at https://github.com/FMLYD/PSW-I.",

      "weaknesses": "1. The biggest issue from my end is the lack of standard deviation. From Table 1, the error of the proposed method seems really good, but i am not informed if these results are averaged over multiple train/test runs or just one run. To avoid cherry picking, the authors are encouraged to highlight how these numbers were obtained, what the training/test splits were, and what hyperparameter selection/cross-validation process was involved, etc.  Similar expectations apply to table 3 and 4. \n\n2. Lack of convergence discussion/analysis. From Fig. 3 and Section 3.4, the imputation procedure seems to repeatedly sample patches from the time series, compute PSW, and use the gradient of the PSW to update the imputation. There seems a lack of convergence guarantees or discussions about this procedure. Can authors provide at least some discussion on this? \n\n3. Data noise issue. Real time series data often includes noises. That means, just computing the distance after DFT in lin154 might be affected by data noises. Have the authors consider any methods or trade-offs, such as low-pass filters, in your SWD definition, to improve the robustness and/or counteract the noise effect?",

What does this description mean?\n\n- What does Lemma 3.2 indicate? How do you know 'deviates more from the typical elements of \\beta'? Further, how do you know the PSW discrepancy avoid the problem indicated by this lemma? In Theorem C.2, the perturbation in PSW discrepancy is shown. Is it possible to compare this with Lemma 3.2? Even if it is possible, what does it mean? Is it clear how large (or small) perturbation caused by outliers ultimately affect the final imputation?\n\n- Although D_KL is used in (2), T 1_m and T^T 1_n is not a probability distribution (because the normalization (sum equals 1) constraint is removed). How are they normalized?\n\n- What is the definition of the 'DFT matrix' in the gradient? How does the gradient of (2) become \\Delta_alpha_i P and \\Delta_beta_j P? The second term in (2) disappear? The optimality condition wrt T is considered in this gradient calculation?  \n\n- After (1), D is squared distance, while in definition 3.1 D is distance without square. Which is correct?\n\nMinor issues:\n\n- In the end of p3: Fig. 4 should be Fig 1? In Fig 1(a), the left is W^(F)?\n\n- The first word of Sec3.2: 'time-series' -> 'Time-series'",
