    "abstract": "The key issue of zero-shot image recognition (ZIR)  is how to infer the relationship between visual space and semantic space from seen classes, and then effectively transfer the  relationship to unseen classes. Recently, most methods have focused on how to use images and class semantic vectors or class names to learn the relationship between visual space and semantic space. The relationship established by these two methods is class-level and coarse-grained. The differences between images of the same class are ignored, which leads to insufficiently tight relationships and affects the accurate recognition of unseen classes.To tackle such problem, we propose Common Feature learning for Zero-shot Image Recognition (CF-ZIR) method to learn fine-grained visual semantic relationships at the image-level. Based on the inter class association information provided by class semantic vectors, guide the extraction of common visual features between classes to obtain image semantic vectors. Experiments on three widely used benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

      "weaknesses": "1. The motivation in the third paragraph of the introduction, stating that \"most methods focus on how to use images and class semantic vectors or class names to learn the relationship between visual space and semantic space,\" is somewhat inaccurate. In fact, most methods utilize class-level attributes as semantic information. Some also incorporate embeddings of individual attributes to enhance fine-grained associations.\n\n2. Section 3.2 is overly lengthy and has significant overlap with subsequent sections. The overview could be more concise to avoid redundancy and improve clarity.\n\n3. There is confusion around the definitions of semantic space and attribute space. What is the intended difference? In ZSL, attributes are generally considered a type of semantic information, so a clearer distinction would improve understanding.\n\n4. The paper lacks comparisons with recent methods and is limited in dataset diversity. Additional comparisons with recent approaches and experiments on more datasets, such as CUB, FLO, and SUN, would strengthen the evaluation.\n\n5. More extensive experimentation is needed. The current paper includes only two tables and one figure, which is insufficient to support its claims. Particularly, experiments should cover both conventional ZSL and generalized ZSL.\n\nThis paper appears incomplete and requires substantial revision before submission. More work is needed to clarify motivations, streamline the methodology, and provide comprehensive experimental validation.",

In addition, a dual-layer embedding method is proposed to establish fine-grained associations between visual-attributes and visual-semantics. Experimental results show that the CF-ZIR method achieves competitive performance on multiple datasets."

In fact, this issue has been defined as visual-semantic domain shift in previous work and has been discussed in several papers, such as [1], [2] and [3]. This paper does not discuss the differences with them.\n\n- This paper only conducts experiments under the conventional zero-shot learning setting, lacking experiments in generalized zero-shot learning.\n\n- Line 16, \"The relationship established by these two methods is class-level and coarse-grained\", what do these two methods refer to?\n\n- Introduction and Related work sections do not discuss the latest research.\n\n- The ablation experiments are insufficient to validate the claims of this paper, especially regarding zero-shot recognition in three spaces discussed herein.\n\n- The paper discerns fine-grained visual-semantic relationships at the image level, but why are experiments not conducted on fine-grained datasets, such as CUB?\n\n- There is a lack of hyperparameter analysis. The current hyperparameters are not convincing. Are they the same across all datasets?\n\n- How does this method demonstrate advantages for attributes like 'small', 'hunter', and 'fast' on AWA2?",

The meanings of many concepts are difficult to understand. For example, what is ‘the cross domain dictionary learning model’ mentioned in Section 3.2 and what are the particular meanings of ‘common feature’, ‘single dictionary learning model’ and ‘class semantic vectors’? The structure of the model and the calculation process are also hard to understand, what are ‘x2’ and ‘x3’ in Figure 1?\n\nThis paper is filled with grammatical and formatting errors, to the point that it's difficult to list them all. For example, in the abstract, 'zero-shot image recognition (ZIR)' should be 'Zero-shot Image Recognition (ZIR)', 'unseen classes.To tackle' should be ''unseen classes. To tackle', and ' Based on the inter class association information provided by class semantic vectors, guide the extraction of common visual features between classes to obtain image semantic vectors.' should be 'The inter-class association information provided by class semantic vectors guides the extraction of common visual features between classes to obtain image semantic vectors.'\n\nAligning images with attributes is a common idea in existing approaches (Modeling Inter and Intra-Class Relations in the Triplet Loss for Zero-Shot Learning (ICCV19) and Concept Bottleneck Models (ICML20)).\n\nThe author conducted experiments on only three small datasets, two of which are nearly identical (AWA1 and AWA2), and did not compare with multimodal pre-trained models such as CLIP.",
