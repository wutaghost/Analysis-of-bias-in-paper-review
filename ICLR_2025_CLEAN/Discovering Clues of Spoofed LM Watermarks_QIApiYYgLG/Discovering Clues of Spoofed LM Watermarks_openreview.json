    "abstract": "LLM watermarks stand out as a promising way to attribute ownership of LLM-generated text. One threat to watermark credibility comes from spoofing attacks, where an unauthorized third party forges the watermark, enabling it to falsely attribute arbitrary texts to a particular LLM. While recent works have demonstrated that state-of-the-art schemes are in fact vulnerable to spoofing, they lack deeper qualitative analysis of the texts produced by spoofing methods. In this work, we for the first time reveal that there are observable differences between genuine and spoofed watermark texts. Namely, we show that regardless of their underlying approach, all current learning-based spoofing methods consistently leave observable artifacts in spoofed texts, indicative of watermark forgery. We build upon these findings to propose rigorous statistical tests that reliably reveal the presence of such artifacts, effectively discovering that a watermark was spoofed. Our experimental evaluation shows high test power across all current learning-based spoofing methods, providing insights into their fundamental limitations, and suggesting a way to mitigate this threat.",

The effectiveness of the testing hypothesis is validated through experiments. \nThe presentation of figures and tables is relatively clear.",
      "weaknesses": "1.There are various methods for adding watermarks to LLMs, and there may also be multiple ways to forge them. This paper only discusses the red-green watermarking scheme for LLMs and the forgery method of constructing datasets by querying a watermarked model, which is highly restrictive.\n2.The rationale for the assumptions in this paper is insufficient. The paper assumes that forgers, when constructing datasets by querying a watermarked model, will leave traces of forgery due to incomplete knowledge in the dataset. However, if the attacker queries the watermarked model again to supplement the missing knowledge in the forged dataset, they can bypass the limitations of this assumption. In this case, the premise does not hold, making the motivation of the paper weak.",

Additionally, it should experimentally compare the effectiveness of the proposed method against the latest forgery techniques, such as those described by Qi Pang et al. in \"Attacking LLM watermarks by exploiting their strengths\" (arXiv, 2024) and Qilong Wu and Varun Chandrasekaran in \"Bypassing LLM watermarks with color-aware substitutions\" (arXiv, 2024).\n2.Regarding the second Weakness, if an attacker supplements the missing content in the forged dataset by querying the watermarked model again to complete the insufficient knowledge, can this bypass the limitations of the premise assumption and affect the effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper?",

The authors conduct extensive experiments, testing their hypotheses across multiple models, parameter settings, and spoofing techniques, lending empirical robustness to their conclusions.",
      "weaknesses": "1. The paper focuses primarily on a specific watermarking scheme -- the KGW watermark. While this is an important and well-studied case, there are several newer watermarking designs that make spoofing attacks virtually impossible. These alternative methods could be used without the concerns associated with spoofing attacks. As such, the scope of the paper feels limited, as it does not consider the broader landscape of watermarking schemes. Furthermore, the paper mainly studies specific spoofing techniques, such as Stealing and Distillation, which may not fully reflect the evolving and diverse strategies available to attackers.\n\n2.  Some assumptions in the analysis are restrictive, particularly regarding the KGW watermark’s context size, often set at h=1. With this small context, green tokens are more likely to appear in the spoofer's training data, simplifying the spoofing process. For example, the assertion that \"If the context is not in D, the spoofer is forced to select the next token independently of its color\" mainly applies when h is larger, limiting its relevance to cases with small context sizes.\n\n3. The paper would benefit from a deeper exploration of how the context length h influences the statistical tests’ performance. Additionally, discussing broader applications and limitations for various watermark types could enhance the study’s relevance. For instance, cryptographic watermark designs, such as those based on pseudorandom error-correcting codes, may not face spoofing issues, and a comparison with these designs could provide more context on the strengths and weaknesses of KGW-style watermarks.",

      "weaknesses": "1. The conclusion is overclaimed. This paper only examined learning-based spoofing attacks but claims that all state-of-the-art spoofing attacks leave artifacts in spoofed texts (in the abstract and introduction). What about spoofing attacks that exploit watermark robustness, e.g., Peng et al. [1] and Zhou et al. [2] in your references?\n\n2. The proposed tests are not practically useful, considering the performance is only good in some cases. In particular, from Table 1, the tests yield high TPR when $ T > 1000 $ and $ h = 3 $ or $ h = 1 $. However, spoofed texts from two learning-based attacks could achieve spoofing attacks when $ T < 1000 $. If their generated text has $ T = 500 $, the corresponding test performance at best is 0.62 (TPR@1%). Does this suggest that the model owner should deploy watermarking with $ h = 3 $?\n\n3. There is no explanation of the important variables or unclear definitions, impeding understanding (see question 1).\n\n\n4. Limited discussions. Intuition suggests that the reason for artifacts is that the spoofer only has partial knowledge due to their limited training data. How will the size of $ D $ affect the artifacts and the statistical test results? Would stronger attackers leave fewer artifacts by increase the size of $D$ or improving the sampling strategy by introducing some independence?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----\n[1] Qi Pang, Shengyuan Hu, Wenting Zheng, and Virginia Smith.

      "weaknesses": "1. The study's scope is primarily confined to the KGW watermark algorithm, leaving significant gaps in the evaluation of other important watermarking approaches. The effectiveness of the proposed method remains untested on unigram watermarking schemes  (zhao et al. 2023) that employ global green/red lists, as well as the KTH  (Kuditipudi et al. 2023)  method utilizing fixed watermark key lists. This limited coverage raises questions about the method's generalizability to alternative watermarking techniques widely used in practice.\n2.  The proposed approach imposes dual requirements of maintaining both significant green/red word ratios and cross-context consistency, which may compromise its robustness. While these requirements enhance the detection accuracy of spoofed watermark text, they could make the system overly sensitive to legitimate text modifications. Because text modification will also cause not consistent context watermark. The paper does not adequately address the critical trade-off between detection accuracy and robustness against common text editing operations. Further investigation is needed to determine whether the method can maintain its effectiveness while accommodating natural text modifications.\n3. The method's requirement for approximately 1000 tokens to achieve reliable detection presents significant practical limitations. This substantial text length requirement restricts the method's applicability in real-world scenarios, particularly for short-form content analysis.",

      "weaknesses": "1. The insight of this paper depends on that 'if the prior contexts are not in the adversary's extracted dataset, the adversary will predict the next token randomly'. If so, utilizing a long context as the seed to determine the green-red split may easily defend the spoofing attack. The original watermark verification method (used in the watermarking scheme) may also be able to distinguish the true watermarked texts from the spoofed watermark texts. Further clarifying the challenges of detecting spoofed texts may help the readers better understand the technical contribution of this paper.\n2. Another concern is that this paper does not include any baseline method in the experiments. I think comparing with some baseline methods (e.g., the original watermark verification method) can help demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n3. Section 5.1 presents the histograms of the distributions. However, a quantitative analysis (e.g., a hypothesis test to verify whether the distribution follows a normal distribution) can better help the readers understand the results.\n4. This paper may not be easy to read for readers who are not familiar with the statistics. I strongly suggest that the authors explain some uncommon symbols and operators. For example, the symbol in Eqs. (3a) and (3b) and the $\\xrightarrow{d}$ in Lemma 4.1.",
