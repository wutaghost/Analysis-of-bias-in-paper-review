    "abstract": "In computational neuroscience, extracting parameters for constructing biologically realistic neural models is a resource-intensive task that requires continuous updates as new research emerges. This paper explores utilizing large language models (LLMs) in automating parameter extraction from scientific literature for biologically realistic neural models. We utilized open-source LLMs via Ollama to construct KGs, capturing parameters such as neuron morphology, synapse dynamics, and receptor properties. SNNBuilder \\cite{Gutierrez2022}, a framework for building spiking neural network (SNN) models, serves as a key validation example for our framework. However, the methodology we outline here can extend beyond SNNs and could applied to systematic modelling of the brain.By experimenting with different prompting strategies—general extraction, in-context hints, and masked prompting—we evaluated the ability of LLMs to autonomously extract relevant data and organize it within an expert-base or data-driven ontology, as well as to infer missing information for neural model construction. Additionally, we implemented retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) via LangChain to further improve the accuracy of parameter extraction through leveraging external knowledge sources. Analysis of the the generated KGs, demonstrated that LLMs, when guided by targeted prompts, can enhance the data-to-model process, paving the way for more efficient parameter extraction and model construction in computational neuroscience.",

      "weaknesses": "* 1\\. The main claims/contributions in the abstract are hard to relate to what experiments and results are reported in the paper:\n   - the “accuracy of parameter extraction” was not evaluated?\n   - the “data-to-model” process was not evaluated?\n   - the “SNNBuilder” was not used in any evaluation?\n   - it's unclear how the characterization of the graphs using the  Leiden Modularity relates to any of the claims\n   - => the suitability of the generated graphs for comp. neuroscience model generation/configuration was therefore neither qualitatively nor quantitatively shown anywhere\n* 2\\. Many methodological details are unclear and missing, and therefore it is unclear how to interpret the results, or how to reproduce the results? (see Questions).\n* 3\\. Many formulations are hard to properly understand, as they are presumably imprecise or incorrectly using technical terms, among others:\n   - “... promoting strategies …” => prompting strategies? (line 58-59)\n   - “... one-shot promoting …” => prompting? (line 82-83)\n   - Spelling errors “nda“ and “sparge“?  (line 169-171)\n   - Unclear what is meant by “ parameterization of brain models” here? (line 34)\n   - Unclear what is meant by “agumenting external data” here? (line 44-45)\n   - Unclear what “brain data” is referring to? (line 51)\n   - “Structurally, this loss is a critical limitation in this approach,…” => the loss of structure? (line 202-203)\n* 4\\. The structuring of the paper is confusing and hard to follow:\n   - The “Preliminaries” section mostly describes experiments and methods unrelated to the rest of the paper, and presumably serves as explanation as to why a different approach is introduced later. Possibly something for the Appendix?\n   - Some results are first described in the Discussion, and additional experiments are introduced in the Discussion.\n* 5\\. Figure 3 is mostly unreadable, and readable parts mostly reflect non neuroscience related terms:\n   - E.g. 3.c: “Keep”, “To”, “It”, “Assuming”, “Based”, “Name:”, “Not”, “\\”, “don’t”, …\n* 6\\. The related literatur section is missing methodologically more closely realted papers.",

      "strengths": "The author focuses on two core areas in the paper:\n1. Using LLM to automatically build and update knowledge graphs from unstructured data\n2. Organizing complex experimental data in neuroscience and converting them into computable models\n\nI think both areas are very interesting and have practical application value.\n\nFor 1, knowledge graphs are difficult to be expanded to a larger scale, updated and deployed in real time due to their high construction and maintenance costs. However, graph databases provide a reliable way to store and reason about complex information. On the one hand, knowledge graphs can benefit from LLM's powerful natural language parsing capabilities, and on the other hand, LLM can benefit from knowledge graphs' reliable information storage methods to alleviate hallucinations.\n\nFor 2, there is a large GAP between current AI research and neuroscience research: researchers in the two fields find it difficult to communicate using the same academic language. For example, a large number of experimental results produced in neuroscience research are difficult to be converted into clear and reusable computational models in the field of machine learning; on the other hand, advanced machine learning models (such as LLM, LVM) lack biological interpretability, and it is difficult to find corresponding experimental evidence in neuroscience. Bridging this GAP in any way will help the two fields communicate and benefit each other.",
      "weaknesses": "As I mentioned in the strengths section, this paper focuses on interesting problems. But I think it is a simple technical report rather than an academic paper. It is not appropriate to publish it at ICLR. (Btw I think this paper uses the iclr template incorrectly, and the margins of the main text are incorrect.) \n\nThe specific areas that can be improved are as follows:\n1. Lack of novelty in the method: The author did not do any further work except proposing three prompts.\n2. Lack of experiments: There are many technical details in designing computational models in the field of neuroscience using LLM. The authors did not conduct/show these experiments.\n\nI will elaborate on these weaknesses in the Question.",
      "questions": "1.Does the SNN model (entity, relation, entity triple) extracted using LLM strictly follow the prompt? Does the author's method in Section 4 effectively alleviate the problems pointed out in Section 3? :\"This result suggests that the LLM with the Graph RAG KG generation approach\ncan struggle to maintain the intended multi-level hierarchy of the ontology when generating the graph, mainly when using the Base Prompt alone.\"\n\n2.How to measure the quality of knowledge graph extracted by LLM? According to Figure 3, there are a large number of meaningless entities in the generated graph, such as \"while, to, the, here, i\". Such a graph is far from meeting the standards of practical applications.\n\n3.An important problem of knowledge graph is entity disambiguation, but it is not shown in the author's research. The author used the well-known open source framework GraphRAG/Neo4j. It is obvious that the existing methods are not good enough, but the author did not make more contributions.\n\n4.Are the SNN models generated by LLM biologically correct and meaningful to biology? For the machine learning community, can these models be used or even lead to better machine learning models? This paper lacks any measurement of the effectiveness of these models.",
