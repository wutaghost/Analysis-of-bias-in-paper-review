    "abstract": "Adaptive loss balancing algorithms play a crucial role in improving the performance of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) by effectively managing the weights assigned to different loss components. Most notably,  Wang et al. (2022) introduced Causal Physics-Informed Neural Networks (Causal PINNs), which achieve superior performance by simply reformulating the loss function based on the causal structure that emerges from time dependency. However, despite their empirical success, a solid theoretical analysis for the effectiveness of Causal PINNs has not received adequate attention. This paper addresses this gap by providing a theoretical rationale for Causal PINNs through the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm, which is commonly used for causal inference. In addition, motivated by this analysis, we propose a Message Passing PINNs (MP-PINNs), a novel adaptive weighting algorithm. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed MP-PINNs significantly outperform existing adaptive weighting methods, exhibiting superior performance in solving complex PDEs. Our findings highlight the potential of MP-PINNs as a powerful tool to enhance both the accuracy \nand efficiency of PINNs.",

In line 90, “to address the failure mode of PINNs.” The paper does not describe what the failure mode of this algorithm is.\n\n2. **Insufficient background**: The paper has not defined the main goal or the notation used in section 2, which may make it difficult to read.\n\n3. **Theoretical analysis organization**: The paper does not present the results as theorems and proofs but rather writes the results in paragraph form, making it less formal.\n\nWhile the empirical performance looks good, I think the current version of this paper is not yet ready for ICLR.",

The authors provide theoretical justification for Causal PINNs by analyzing the belief propagation algorithm. Specifically, they find that running BP over a Markov random field yields the weighting used in Causal PINNs. Next, the authors propose a message passing-based alternative form of PINNs that outperforms adaptive weighting methods for PDEs. Empirically, they demonstrate that these perform better than alternative PINN approaches on a variety of time-dependent PDEs."
