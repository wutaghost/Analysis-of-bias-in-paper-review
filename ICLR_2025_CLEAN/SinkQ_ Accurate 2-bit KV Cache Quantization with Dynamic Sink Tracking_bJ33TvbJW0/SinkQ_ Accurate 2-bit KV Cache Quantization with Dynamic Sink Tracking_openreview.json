    "abstract": "The impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) come at the cost of substantial computational resources during deployment. While KV Cache can significantly reduce recomputation during inference, it also introduces additional memory overhead. KV Cache quantization presents a promising solution, striking a good balance between memory usage and accuracy.\nPrevious research has shown that the Keys are distributed by channel, while the Values are distributed by token. Consequently, the common practice is to apply channel-wise quantization to the Keys and token-wise quantization to the Values. However, our further investigation reveals that a small subset of unusual tokens exhibit unique characteristics that deviate from this pattern, which can substantially impact quantization accuracy. Furthermore, these tokens often have higher attention scores, exacerbating their quantization errors.\nTo address this, we develop a simple yet effective method to identify these tokens accurately during the decoding process and exclude them from quantization, significantly improving overall accuracy. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves significant accuracy improvements under 2-bit quantization and can deliver a 6.4× reduction in memory usage and a 2.3× increase in throughput. Our code will be released upon acceptance.",

      "strengths": "- This work provides thorough ablation studies and insightful findings on KV cache compression, particularly the role of attention distribution and the characteristics of tokens that function as attention \"sinks.\"\n- By excluding high-attention tokens from quantization, SinkQ effectively preserves accuracy under 2-bit quantization, making it feasible for real-time applications that require efficient memory usage.\n- SinkQ’s compatibility with methods like KIVI, which uses channel-wise and token-wise quantization, demonstrates flexibility and potential for integration with other compression frameworks.",
      "weaknesses": "- The paper lacks an in-depth discussion of the computational overhead introduced by steps such as slicing, concatenation, and the calculation of outlier tokens. A profiling of these operations would help to understand the real-world efficiency impact.\n- The paper compares SinkQ with KIVI but does not include comparisons with other KV cache compression methods, such as KVQuant, [1], GEAR [2] and SKVQ [3]. \n- SinkQ could be considered an innovation that combines aspects of token-dropping approaches, such as those in StreamingLLM [4] and H2O [5], with quantization strategies.

      "body": "This paper presents SinkQ, a 2-bit quantization technique designed to improve the memory efficiency of KV cache in LLMs. This method dynamically identifies and tracks \"sink tokens\"—tokens with high attention scores that would otherwise suffer from quantization errors—and excludes them from quantization to retain accuracy. The SinkQ approach offers notable memory and throughput benefits, achieving a $6.4\\times$ reduction in memory usage and a $2.3\\times$ increase in throughput, while minimally impacting model accuracy. It is implemented in a hardware-friendly way, providing compatibility with common LLM frameworks."

      "strengths": "1. This paper studies an important problem.\n2. The proposed approach is well-motivated by the authors' observation.",
      "weaknesses": "1. The authors' observation of sink tokens is not new or novel. Previous works have observed the existence of heavy-hitter tokens [1] or salient tokens [2] in LLMs, which may occur at any token position. Hence, the claim on line 211 is inaccurate: \"Previous work suggesting that attention sinks occur only in the initial tokens...\"\n2. The proposed method lacks novelty. The proposed mixed-precision approach for KV cache quantization is similar to previous works [2,3], which also identify outlier tokens in the KV cache and preserve in higher precision or full precision.\n3. The \"Method\" section is incomplete, missing some important details. It is not clear how SinkQ identifies the sink tokens, which is a critical part of the proposed method. During inference, the tokens are ingested in a streaming manner, while the authors only describe how the outlier tokens can be identified after saving all keys in an offline manner on line 152.\n4. Baselines are missing from the experiments. Since the authors adopt a mixed-precision quantization approach, mixed-precision baselines, such as KVQuant and ZipCache, are more relevant than the KIVI baseline. Moreover, the comparison with KIVI feels like an unfair comparison; since SinkQ directly adopts the KIVI approach (per-channel for keys and per-token for values, with residual cache) and adds sink tokens, the model quality will certainly outperform KIVI, but with memory and latency overheads. These overheads are not made very clear in Table 1 and 2.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Zhang, Zhenyu, et al. \"H2o: Heavy-hitter oracle for efficient generative inference of large language models.\" NeurIPS 2023.\n\n[2] He, Yefei, et al. \"ZipCache: Accurate and Efficient KV Cache Quantization with Salient Token Identification.\" NeurIPS 2024.\n\n[3] Dong, Shichen, et al. \"QAQ: Quality Adaptive Quantization for LLM KV Cache.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2403.04643 (2024).",

      "weaknesses": "1. The major claim of this paper lacks sufficient justification. The foundation of the work is based on the statement, \"Previous work suggests that attention sinks occur only in the initial tokens; however, our observations reveal that they can appear at any position within a sentence.\" However, there is no concrete evidence or examples provided to support this strong claim. To strengthen the paper, it would be beneficial if the authors included specific evidence, such as visualizations or quantitative analysis, to demonstrate instances where attention sinks appear at various positions within a sentence.\n2. In the experiments, Figure 3(b) and Figure 3(c) suggest that the proposed method may not be as memory-efficient as Kiwi, despite claims of improved efficiency. It would be helpful for the authors to directly address this observation and clarify the reasons behind this apparent discrepancy. A more detailed analysis of the trade-offs between the proposed method and Kiwi in terms of memory efficiency would strengthen the discussion.\n3. There are other state-of-the-art KV cache methods, such as those referenced in [1] and [2], which should be considered as additional baselines. Including these baselines would provide a more comprehensive evaluation. It would also be beneficial for the authors to explain why these specific baselines were not included initially and how their method compares to the key innovations introduced in [1] and [2].\n\n[1] Hooper C, Kim S, Mohammadzadeh H, et al.

      "weaknesses": "`-` The take-away from section 4.3 is unclear: When the choice of group size (G) / residual length (R) varies, would the throughput increase as compared to KIVI be consistent?

The broader concern here is about scalability --- Please refer to \"questions\".\n\n`-` Minor issues: Please consider fixing the y-axis of figures 1b and 1e, and the citation on line 210.",
      "questions": "Thank you for submitting this paper for ICLR. I have one concern below and I greatly appreciate it if the authors can offer some insights or clarification. I don't think it would require new experiment results:\n\n- Scalability: I understand that it would be difficult to run experiments on larger LLMs (like the 70B+ models), but one missing point in the paper is how SinkQ would succeed (or fail) when the number of model parameters or the context length continuously go up. One potential consequence I can think of could be that the number of outlier tokens (i.e. attention sinks) grow quickly as the scale of the model / the context increase. In this case, would a small size of sink_num work? From table 4, it seems to me that using sink_num=1 should be sufficient, but that seems a bit too good to be true in most cases. If not, to support a larger size of sink_num, how would the extra memory overhead look like? --- This is one concern I have when I take a closer look at figure 3b. And if the memory overhead is too large and you have to use a small, fixed number of sinks (which means that you cannot store all outlier tokens), would SinkQ still be superior to KIVI in this case?",
