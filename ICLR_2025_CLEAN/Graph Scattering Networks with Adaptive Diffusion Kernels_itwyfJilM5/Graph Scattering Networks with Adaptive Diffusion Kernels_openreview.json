    "abstract": "Scattering networks are deep convolutional architectures that use predefined wavelets for feature extraction and representation. They have proven effective for classification tasks, especially when training data is scarce, where traditional deep learning methods struggle. In this work, we introduce and develop a mathematically sound framework for applying adaptive kernels to diffusion wavelets in graph scattering networks. Stability guarantees with respect to input perturbations are provided. A specific construction of adaptive kernels is presented and applied with continuous diffusion to perform graph classification tasks on benchmark datasets. Our model consistently outperforms traditional graph scattering networks with predefined wavelets, both in scenarios with limited and abundant training data.",

      "strengths": "The geometric scattering transform (GST) provides a theoretically solid framework for understanding multi-scale GNNs from a graph signal processing point of view. However, the original versions of it are limited in their numerical effectiveness because they are overly handcrafted. This paper shows viable ways of increasing the effectiveness of the (GST) while retaining its nice theoretical properties. This therefore helps bridge the gap between ``things that work well” and ``things which are well understood” which is important since GNNs etc are increasingly used in real-world tasks.",
      "weaknesses": "Right before the start of Section 4, I think $v$ should be defined in terms of the square-root of the degree vector (since you are using the symmetrized diffusion operator).\n\nThe discussion of Forward Euler etc in the end of Section 4.1 seems out of place in this paper. While it is indeed a useful insight from GRAND etc., I don’t see its relevance on diffusion wavelets which are already in discrete time\n\nIt seems to me that you should be able to take $N(\\beta_A)=1$ 1 in Proposition 4.2 by imitating the proof of Proposition 4.1 of Gama et al. (2019a). (It might also be useful to look at the proof of Proposition 2.2 of Perlmutter et al `` Understanding Graph Neural Networks with Generalized Geometric Scattering Transforms” (2023).) I believe this would then allow you to establish the stability your method to additive noise (as is common in most formulations of the scattering transform).\n\nRelated Works:\n\nImportant: The second paragraph omits `` Graph Convolutional Neural Networks via Scattering” (Zou and Lerman 2020). This omission is particularly noteworthy because it is the first paper on graph scattering, predating Gama et al. by a couple of months. (The final publication date is later, but this is an artifact of the journal review process.)\n\nLess important: Additionally, the discussion of incorporating learning into geometric scattering (Section 5) should likely also include ``Overcoming Oversmoothness in Graph Convolutional Networks via Hybrid Scattering Networks” (Wenkel et al. 2022). This paper introduced learning into the scattering framework in a different way than the Tong et al. paper that the authors mention. (As noted in Tong, these two forms of learnable scattering, as well as this one, are compatible and can be combined.) It also should likely include `` Scattering Networks for Hybrid Representation Learning” (Oyallon et al. 2018) and `` Separation and Concentration in Deep Networks” (Zarka et al. 2020) which incorporate learning into Euclidean scattering.\n\nNotational inconsistencies:\n\nThere is inconsistent use of ``x” vs ``u” in Section 4.1\n\n$A^*$ is used without being defined. Also, why do you use both $^*$ and $^T$ in equation 2? If the matrices are real this should be the same, right? \n\nIn line 221, it would be more natural to call $p_\\epsilon$ instead $d_\\epsilon to be consistent with the proceed paragraph (or instead call them both $p$)\n\nVery Minor: (Do not affect my score but should be fixed)\n\nLine 54: ``we pursue on alleviating” is awkward. Please rephrase.\nThroughout: Things like ``Section 5” are proper nouns and should be capitalized.\nThroughout: Some quotation marks point the wrong way (which is an unfortunate artifact of LaTeX sometimes being a pain)\n\nThroughout, some of the equations with $e^{stuff}$ are hard to read and it would be better to write $\\exp(stuff)$.",
      "questions": "Why do we need a metric space, in addition to the measure space? Chew et al. `` Geometric scattering on measure spaces” (2024) should that the geometric scattering transform could be extended to measure spaces where there was not an obvious metric structure (e.g., digraphs). \n\nIn Section 3.1, what norm is being used? This is relevant because $P$ is an asymmetric matrix (which is similar to \\overline{P} used in Section 3.2). In Perlmutter et al `` Understanding Graph Neural Networks with Generalized Geometric Scattering Transforms” (2023) it was shown that the natural choice of norm differs depending on whether one uses a symmetric or asymmetric diffusion matrix (for asymmetric matrices you should use a norm weighted in terms of degrees).\n\nIn Section 3.1, could you provide examples of when there we be a strict inequality in line 140? It seems to me that in most cases, this will be equality. For the standard diffusion matrix, I believe that the bottom eigenspace will be zeroed out in the limit, but the other eigenspaces are never fully suppressed (which is why you need epsilon in the next paragraph). \n\nCould the authors please provide examples of setting where having dependence on the sampling density is preferable (as claimed in line 226, ``Naturally…”)? I thought this was typically a nuisance which one would attempt to normalize out (as in line 222).\n\nThe unnumbered equations in lines 246-251 are hard to understand. Could the authors please provide some intuition?",

      "body": "This paper seeks to develop a generalized graph scattering transform which learns the transition matrix $A$ through a kernel inspired by the attentional diffusion method from Chamberlain et al. (2021). \n\nThey take the initial node features $g_u$, map them into an embedding space by a learnable function $W$ and then build a diffusion operator via a kernel derived from the \\{W(g_u)\\}_{u\\in V} and further add in learning of the diffusion operator via a multiheaded attention mechanism. \n\nAfter the attention mechanism, they then use the diffusion matrix $A$ to define diffusion wavelets of the form $\\psi_j=A^{t_{j-1}}-A^{t_j}$ and use these wavelets to define a graph scattering transform. (This part is ``standard” and similar to other works such as Gama et al. (2019a) and Gao et al. (2019).) Additionally, they prove that their generalized graph scattering transform has similar theoretical properties to other versions of the geometric scattering transform and show strong numerical performance.\n\nOverall, I think this is a good paper which needs a bit of work before it is publication worthy as described below. If these concerns are sufficiently addressed, I will likely raise my score."

However, the main motivation of this paper is to make existing scattering learnable and adaptive, which scarifies the internal advantages mentioned above.\n2. Complexity. For a scattering network with $L$ layer and $h$ children for each parent node, the total number of filters is $\\sum_{l=1}^{L}h^l$, an exponential function. If we make all filters learnable, the computing is very high and unbearable.\n3. Experiments. The baselines are too old. More graph scattering methods are suggested to compare.\n4. Writing.
