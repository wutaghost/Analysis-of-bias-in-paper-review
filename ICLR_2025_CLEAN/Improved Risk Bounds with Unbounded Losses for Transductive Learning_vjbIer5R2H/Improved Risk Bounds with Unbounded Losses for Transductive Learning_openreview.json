    "abstract": "In the transductive learning setting, we are provided with a labeled training set and an unlabeled test set, with the objective of predicting the labels of the test points. This framework differs from the standard problem of fitting an unknown distribution with a training set drawn independently from this distribution. In this paper, we primarily improve the generalization bounds in transductive learning. Specifically, we develop two novel concentration inequalities for the suprema of empirical processes sampled without replacement for unbounded functions, marking the first discussion of the generalization performance of unbounded functions in the context of sampling without replacement. We further provide two valuable applications of our new inequalities: on one hand, we firstly derive fast excess risk bounds for empirical risk minimization in transductive learning under unbounded losses. On the other hand, we establish high-probability bounds on the generalization error for graph neural networks when using stochastic gradient descent which improve the current state-of-the-art results.",

      "strengths": "The transductive setting has gained renewed attention recently, as many practical problems are better suited to transductive learning than the traditional iid statistical framework. In this context, the work is particularly relevant.\n\nThe concentration bounds presented are non-trivial, and their proof involves sophisticated mathematical tools.",
      "weaknesses": "1. The authors do not offer any motivation for addressing unbounded loss. A discussion on why this is an important and relevant problem to study would be beneficial.\n\n2. It is unclear what the significance of Theorems 3 and 4 is. Let’s consider Theorem 3 as an example. Given other terms, the upper bound can at best be\n$$ \\frac{N^2 \\log\\left( \\frac{1}{\\delta}\\right)}{m^2 u}.$$\nThe authors claim this bound is state-of-the-art for $m = o(N^{2/5})$. If we set $m = N^{1/5} = o(N^{2/5})$, then $u = N - N^{1/5} \\leq N $, and the upper bound is at least\n$$ \\geq \\frac{N^2 \\log\\left( \\frac{1}{\\delta}\\right)}{N^{2/5} \\cdot N} \\geq N^{3/5} \\log\\left( \\frac{1}{\\delta}\\right).$$\n\nGiven that this is the highest the proven upperbound can be, it is difficult to see why such a bound would be of interest as $N$ can be quite large, making the bound potentially vacuous. I may likely be missing something here, and I would be happy to engage with the authors during the discussion session to gain further clarity and adjust my score.",
      "questions": "1. Given the claim that the authors prove new results for unbounded loss, it would be helpful to discuss what is already known in the context of bounded loss. Are similar concentration inequalities established for the bounded loss setting? The paper references [1,12] as proving some tail bounds—could the authors provide a brief summary of the results from those works?\n\n\n\n2. See the weakness mentioned above. Could the authors offer a clearer explanation of how to interpret Theorems 3 and 4? Specifically, how should the generalization bound behave as the size of the training set $m$ increases? Does the bound vanish in any meaningful way as $m$ increases, and if so, how?",

The main difference the author claims is that the risk bounds are for unbounded functions. However, such claim, together with the technical results for  unbounded functions, are very questionable.",
      "weaknesses": "There are several major technical drawbacks.\n\n\n\n1. While this paper claims that the risk bounds for transductive learning are for unbounded loss functions, the assumptions required for the results are essentially designed for bounded loss functions. For example, the main results Theorem 3 and Theorem 4 need the assumption that $E[f^2] \\le B E[f]$. It is well known that such assumption, $E[f^2] \\le B E[f]$, holds mainly for bounded loss functions, such as that in the classical local Rademacher complexity work (Bartlett Local Rademacher Complexities, AOS 2005). It turns out that while the paper claims risk bounds for \"unbounded loss\", but the results rely on the assumption which mainly hold for bounded loss functions.\n\n2. It is well known that Rademacher complexity or local Rademacher complexity based methods derive distribution-free risk bounds that do not need distributional assumptions. In contrast, the risk bounds in the main results Theorem 3 and Theorem 4 require sub-Gaussian and sub-exponential loss functions. It is not clear which loss functions are  sub-Gaussian or sub-exponential, and such restriction on the loss functions can significantly limit the application scope of the derived bounds.\n\n3. There are no detailed comparison to the current state-of-the-art risk bounds for the main results in Theorem 3 and Theorem 4, such as the existing transductive bounds in (Tolstikhin et al. 2014, Localized Complexities for Transductive Learning. COLT 2014). Without comparison to prior art, the significance of these results is not clear and questionable.\n\n4. The risk bounds in the main results, Theorem 3 and Theorem 4, do not convergence to 0 under the case that $m = N^{\\alpha}$ or \n$m = N^{\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha \\in (0,1/2]$, and they even diverge to $\\infty$ if $\\alpha \\in (0,1/2)$.  This is in a strong contrast to existing risk bounds for excess risk bounds where such bounds should always at least converge to $0$, and it is really misleading to claim such risk bounds are improved ones.",
