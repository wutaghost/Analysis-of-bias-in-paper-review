    "abstract": "Overparameterized models trained with (stochastic) gradient descent are ubiquitous in modern machine learning. These large models achieve unprecedented performance on test data, but their theoretical understanding is still limited. In this paper, we take a step towards filling this gap by adopting an optimization perspective. More precisely, we study the implicit regularization properties of the gradient flow “algorithm” for estimating the parameters of a deep diagonal neural network. Our main contribution is showing that this gradient flow induces a mirror flow dynamic on the model, meaning that it is biased towards a specific solution of the problem depending on the initialization of the network. Along the way, we prove several properties of the trajectory.",

      "strengths": "- The paper introduces a mild technical assumption $\\mathcal{A}$ on the initialization which holds almost surely for a random initialization. Under this assumption, the gradient flow for the parameterization of deep diagonal network can be rewritten as mirror flow with a *convex* potential on the linear predictor $\\theta$, which is an interesting technical observation. \n- Under the same assumption, the linear convergence for any loss function $L$ which satisfies $PL$ condition in $\\theta$ is established.",
      "weaknesses": "- The major weakness is the mirror potential is not explicitly defined - even if it not explicitly defined the limiting behavior in the case of large depth or small initialization are not discussed or analyzed which is a major drawback. \n- The implicit bias of optimization benefits/drawbacks of the depth is not discussed and this weakens the motivation for studying the deep diagonal linear networks.",

In addition,  the characterization of certain properties of the learning dynamics of deep diagonal linear networks might also be interesting, e.g., the second point of Proposition 1.",
      "weaknesses": "Unfortunately, both the technical and theoretical contributions of this paper are rather limited, which I will discuss as follows. \n\n1. The ultimate goal of this paper is to reveal the implicit regularization effect of GF for deep diagonal linear networks. However, the explicit form of the corresponding entropy function for the induced mirror flow dynamics is completely absent. There is even no suggestion about possible properties that the entropy function should have. \n\n    In addition, the derivation of the mirror flow form is a direct application of results in Li et al., 2022, and the first point of Proposition 1 can be a direct application of the Euler’s theorem for homogeneous function. Thus I think the technical contributions of this paper are rather limited. \n2. As a comparison, Yun et al., 2021 already explicitly characterized the implicit bias of deep diagonal linear networks by using the tensor network formulation developed in their paper. \n\n   Specifically, they established the optimization problem with an explicit form of the entropy function that the GF dynamics of deep diagonal linear networks (note that they did not require the parameterization $u^{\\odot L} - v^{\\odot L}$) aims to solve. They also established the convergence of the dynamics. The only possible weakness of their result is the additional requirement of the initialization, which the authors in this paper are able to relax at the cost of the characterization for explicit form of entropy function. But I cannot view such relaxation as a significant theoretical contribution that is sufficient for this paper to be published in its current version. \n\n**Reference**\n\nYun et al., 2022.
