    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that pre-trained vision-language models can effectively adapt to diverse downstream tasks through parameter-efficient prompt tuning. Unfortunately, the tuned models can exploit spurious correlations during prediction, resulting in a failure to generalize to out-of-distribution test data, especially when the tuning dataset exhibits bias. How to achieve cross-modal mitigation of spurious correlations during prompt tuning of vision-language models remains an open question. In this paper, the challenging problem is tackled by leveraging the stable relationship between necessary and sufficient causal features and the corresponding label. On the one hand, we constrain the learning process of prompt by reinforcing the necessary and sufficient connection between the textual labels and textual features. On the other hand, the probability of necessity and sufficiency between the textual features and the filtered visual features is measured and maximized to enhance cross-modal feature alignment. By iteratively optimizing these two objectives, we can achieve cross-modal mitigation of spurious correlations because the logic equivalence between textual labels and visual features is bolstered. The theoretical analysis on generalization error indicates that our method can achieve a tighter generalization error bound than existing approaches. We evaluate the proposed method on several commonly adopted out-of-distribution datasets, and the empirical results demonstrate the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art competitors.",

The authors introduce a new concept, logic alignment, which integrates the mitigation of spurious correlations with cross-modal alignment of representations, and demonstrates its effectiveness through theoretical analysis and empirical results on various out-of-distribution datasets. LogicAI-PT earns competitive performance compared with traditional prompt-tuning methods for CLIP model."

      "weaknesses": "The paper is not easy to follow. This is due to the symbols being confused, e.g., $\\Phi$ denotes the filter in Cross-modal logic alignment but visual representation space in Textual logic alignment. \nWhile the first half of the paper explains the idea and motivation well, creating a rightful sense of expectation of the result, the section on the results somewhat comes short of delivering the findings with a bang.  After reading the first half I was excited to read the next pages to find \"Where are those indeed integrated areas for boosting the expected performance \", and tingling with an expectation of learning something new. But then, for some reason, the Overall Performance and Ablation Study sections are very timid and just present dry numbers for each of the tests that were planned.  \n\n1. It would be helpful to include a better explanation of what the \"spurious correlation in vision-language models\" is exactly. Maybe a picture. \n2.The paper borrowed too much content from the existing papers and it could be removed by referring these papers. Even so, the motivation is not clear since the authors employ PNS without explanation.\n\n3. Page 6, Section 4.1: The NSC feature shown Figure 1 is not explained by the authors themselves how to make use and take advantage of this. \n\n4. Compared to CoOPood,  it seems that the proposed method exploits PNS terms instead of mutual information to align cross-modal representations. I am wondering how effective the PNS term is in cross-modal mitigation of spurious correlation.  \n5. Why was it necessary to do textual logic alignment?",
      "questions": "I would like to hear the authors' discussion regarding the three weakness that I highlikeed above:\n\n1. Usefulness of the PNS term. \n\n2. Usefulness of the textual logic alignment. \n\n3. How to extractive NSC features in textual and visual modality.",
